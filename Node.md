3) It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser to execute JavaScript code.
4) Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, allowing them to build scalable and high-performance web applications.
5) Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently.
6) Event-driven architecture: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture, allowing developers to  respond to events and build applications that can handle multiple connections simultaneously.
