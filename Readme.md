# Promises vs. Async/Await:

Promises: Promises are a pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises provide a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

Async/Await: Async/Await is a syntax built on top of promises, introduced in ECMAScript 2017. It provides a more concise and readable way to work with asynchronous code. The async keyword is used to declare that a function returns a promise, and the await keyword is used within the function to wait for the resolution of a promise.

# Prototype in JavaScript:

In JavaScript, each object has a prototype, which is a reference to another object. This prototype object may, in turn, have its prototype, forming a prototype chain. The prototype is used for inheritance in JavaScript. When you access a property or method on an object, and it's not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype and continues up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.

# Event Bubbling:

Event bubbling is a mechanism in the DOM where an event triggered on a particular element will bubble up or propagate through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. This means that if you have nested HTML elements and an event occurs on the innermost element, the event will also trigger on all the outer elements containing it.

# Limitations of React:

Learning Curve: React has a learning curve, especially for beginners who may need time to grasp concepts like JSX, components, state, and props.
JSX Limitations: JSX might seem unintuitive to developers who are more accustomed to HTML.
SEO Issues: React applications are often single-page applications (SPAs), and there can be challenges with search engine optimization (SEO) due to the initial rendering being done on the client side.
Boilerplate Code: Some developers find that React projects can involve a lot of boilerplate code.
Context vs. Redux:

# Context in React:

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's often used for global state management in smaller applications where a centralized state is needed without the complexity of Redux.

# Redux:

Redux is a state management library that is often used in larger React applications. It provides a predictable state container and follows a unidirectional data flow. Redux is suitable for complex state management scenarios where the application state needs to be managed more rigorously.

# Controlled Components vs. Uncontrolled Components:

Controlled Components: In React, a controlled component is a component whose state is controlled by React. Form elements like input, textarea, and select maintain their own state, and their values are controlled by React through state. Changes to the input values trigger state updates.

Uncontrolled Components: An uncontrolled component is a component where the form data is handled by the DOM itself. The state is not controlled by React, and the data is accessed directly from the DOM using refs. Uncontrolled components are less common in React, but they can be useful in certain scenarios.

Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components:

Controlled Components: Form elements where the value is managed by the component state using the useState hook. User changes trigger state updates and re-renders.
Uncontrolled Components: Form elements where the value is directly accessed from the DOM using refs. They update asynchronously and might require additional logic for validation and synchronization.

Error Boundaries in React:

Error boundaries are a feature in React that allows components to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their component tree and log those errors, display a fallback UI, or take other appropriate actions. This prevents the entire application from crashing due to a single error in a component.
Example of using error boundaries:

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = { hasError: false };
}

static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
return { hasError: true };
}

componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
}

render() {
if (this.state.hasError) {
return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
}

    return this.props.children;

}
}

# ** ----------------------- JAVASCRIPT --------------------------------- **#

# What is JavaScript?

Answer:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. It enables client-side scripting, allowing developers to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. JavaScript is an essential component of web development, providing the ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and communicate with servers using technologies like AJAX.

# How is JavaScript different from Java?

Answer:
Despite their similar names, JavaScript and Java are distinct programming languages. JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development, executed in web browsers. It's lightweight and dynamically typed. On the other hand, Java is a full-fledged, object-oriented programming language designed for general-purpose applications, often used for back-end development. The similarity in names is mainly due to marketing reasons, and the two languages have different use cases and syntax.

# What are the data types in JavaScript?

Answer:
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types:

Number
String
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol (introduced in ES6)
Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:

Object
Array
Function
Date
RegExp
Primitive data types are immutable, and non-primitive types are mutable and stored by reference.

# Explain hoisting in JavaScript.

Answer:
Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This allows variables and functions to be used before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
In this example, the declaration of x is hoisted to the top, but the initialization is not. Hence, the output is undefined.

# What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?

Answer:
The Event Loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous operations to be performed without blocking the execution of the main program. It continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the first task from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. This process ensures that asynchronous operations, such as AJAX requests or timers, are handled in a non-blocking way.

# Lazy loading

Lazy loading is a technique in which you defer the loading of non-essential resources or components until they are actually needed. In React, lazy loading is commonly used for code-splitting, where you load parts of your application only when the user navigates to a specific route or interacts with a particular feature

# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers.

# What are the key features of JavaScript?

JavaScript is dynamically typed, supports functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, and is used for client-side as well as server-side development (with platforms like Node.js)
.

# What is the difference between null and undefined?

null represents the intentional absence of any object value, whereas undefined indicates the absence of a value in general. null is a value that can be assigned to a variable, whereas undefined usually means the variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

# What is hoisting in JavaScript?

#Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code execution. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

# What are closures in JavaScript?

Closures are functions that have access to their own scope, the scope in which they were defined, and the global scope. This allows for the preservation of the state of variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

# What is the event loop in JavaScript?

The event loop is a single-threaded mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous callbacks. It continuously checks the call stack for functions to execute, and when it's empty, it looks at the message queue. If there are any messages, it processes them one by one.

# What is the difference between == and === operators?

The == operator checks for equality after type coercion, whereas the === operator checks for equality without type coercion. In other words, === checks for both value and type equality, whereas == only checks for value equality after type conversion.

**Imp1**
console.log("1" == 1) // it gives true
console.log("1" === 1) // it gives false

console.log(1 + "b") // 1b
console.log(a + "b") // a is not defined
console.log("a" - "b") // Nan
**Imp2**

# What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?

_Ans_ Prototypal inheritance is a way of creating objects in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype.

# What are some ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript?

_Ans_ Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await are common ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. Callbacks were traditionally used, Promises were introduced to simplify callback hell, and Async/Await is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises to make asynchronous code look synchronous.

# Explain the concept of event bubbling and event capturing.

_Ans_ Event bubbling is the process where an event propagates from the target element up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.

_Ans_ Event capturing is the opposite — the event starts from the top of the DOM tree and propagates downwards to the target element.

# What is NaN property in JavaScript?

_Highlight_ NaN property represents the “Not-a-Number” value. It indicates a value that is not a legal number. _Highlight_

_NOTE_ console.log(typeof null) // {} || object _NOTE_
_NOTE_ console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined _NOTE_

console.log(typeof NaN) // number

typeof of NaN will return a Number.

To check if a value is NaN, we use the isNaN() function,

_NOTE_ isNaN() function converts the given value to a Number type, and then equates to NaN. _NOTE_

isNaN("Hello") // Returns true

isNaN(345) // Returns false

isNaN('1') // Returns false, since '1' is converted to Number type which results in 0 ( a number)

isNaN(true) // Returns false, since true converted to Number type results in 1 ( a number)

isNaN(false) // Returns false

isNaN(undefined) // Returns true

# Explain passed by value and passed by reference.

Ans:- In JavaScript,

**primitive data** types are **passed by value** and

var x = 2 // address store with the x
var y = x; // y target to x

var x = 3  // x store the new value 3

console.log(y)  // **Ans** =  2

**non-primitive data** types are **passed by reference.**

var obj = {"name":"rohit"}
var obj2 = obj;

obj.name = "chourey"

console.log(obj2)   // **Ans** {"name":"chourey"}

# What is coercion in javascript?
**Ans** 
In JavaScript, ``` coercion refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another.```

Coercion can occur implicitly or explicitly:

**Implicit coercion:** 

$$
 This occurs when JavaScript automatically converts the data type of a value during operations such as comparisons or arithmetic operations. For example, when you use the + operator with different data types, JavaScript may attempt to convert one or both of the operands to a common data type before performing the operation.
$$

javascript
Copy code
let num = 10;
let str = "20";
let result = num + str; // result will be "1020" (string concatenation), str is implicitly coerced to a string

**Explicit coercion:** 

$$
This occurs when you explicitly convert a value from one data type to another using functions or operators like parseInt(), parseFloat(), String(), Number(), or the unary plus operator (+).
$$

javascript
Copy code
let str = "10";
let num = parseInt(str); // Explicitly convert str to a number

Coercion in JavaScript can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or bugs, so it's important to be aware of how JavaScript handles type conversions. It's often recommended to explicitly convert values when necessary to make the code more readable and to avoid ambiguity.

# What is call back hell? give example

``` Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom" or "callback spaghetti," refers to a situation in asynchronous programming where code becomes difficult to read and maintain due to nested callbacks within callbacks ```. 

This occurs particularly in languages that heavily use callbacks for handling asynchronous operations, such as JavaScript.

asyncFunction1(param1, function(err, result1) {
    if (err) {
        handleError(err);
    } else {
        asyncFunction2(result1, function(err, result2) {
            if (err) {
                handleError(err);
            } else {
                asyncFunction3(result2, function(err, result3) {
                    if (err) {
                        handleError(err);
                    } else {
                        // Do something with result3
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
});


<----------------------------------------------- HTML AND CSS QUESTION ----------------------------------------------------------------->
Certainly! Here are the answers to the HTML5 interview questions:

# What are the new features introduced in HTML5?

HTML5 introduced several new features such as semantic elements (like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, etc.), native support for video and audio playback (<video> and <audio> elements), canvas for drawing graphics, local storage capabilities (localStorage and sessionStorage), improved form elements (like <input type="date">, <input type="email">, etc.), and support for offline web applications using the Application Cache.

### Explain the semantic elements introduced in HTML5 and their significance.
Semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, etc., provide meaning to the structure of the webpage, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and developers to understand the content and its hierarchy. They help improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of the code.

### What is the purpose of the <canvas> element in HTML5?
The <canvas> element allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes, graphics, and animations. It provides a JavaScript API for drawing and manipulating graphics on the fly, making it suitable for creating games, data visualization, and interactive multimedia applications.

### How does HTML5 support offline web applications?
HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) mechanism, which allows web applications to be cached locally, enabling them to work offline. Developers can specify which resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) should be cached in the manifest file, allowing the browser to store them for offline use.

### What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in HTML5?

localStorage and sessionStorage are both mechanisms provided by HTML5 for storing data locally in the user's browser. The main difference is in their scope and lifespan:

localStorage: Data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It has no expiration time and remains available until explicitly removed.

sessionStorage: Data stored in sessionStorage persists only for the duration of the page session. Once the browser tab is closed, the data is cleared.

### Explain the purpose of the <video> and <audio> elements in HTML5.
The <video> and <audio> elements allow embedding multimedia content (video and audio) directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. They provide native support for playing video and audio files in various formats, enhancing accessibility and reducing dependency on external plugins.

### What are Web Workers in HTML5? How do they work?
Web Workers are JavaScript scripts that run in the background independently of the main browser thread, allowing long-running tasks to be executed without blocking the user interface. They enable multitasking and parallel processing in web applications by offloading heavy computations, thus improving responsiveness and performance.

### What is the purpose of the <details> and <summary> elements in HTML5?
The <details> and <summary> elements are used to create interactive disclosure widgets that allow users to show or hide additional content. The <details> element represents a disclosure widget container, while the <summary> element provides a visible label or summary for the widget that users can click to toggle the visibility of the associated content.

### How does HTML5 improve form handling and validation?
HTML5 introduced several new input types, attributes, and APIs to enhance form handling and validation:

New input types like email, url, tel, date, etc., provide better user experience and enable browsers to offer native validation and input controls.

Attributes like required, pattern, min, max, etc., allow developers to specify validation rules and constraints directly in HTML, reducing the need for custom JavaScript validation
.
The Constraint Validation API provides a programmatic interface for checking form validity and displaying error messages to users, improving accessibility and usability.

### Explain the purpose of the <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <nav> elements in HTML5.

<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content within a document, typically with a heading, and is often used to divide the content into chapters, sections, or topics.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content of the document, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.
<nav>: Represents a section of the document intended for navigation links, such as menus, table of contents, or breadcrumbs.



<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------CSS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------?

### What are the new features introduced in CSS3?
CSS3 introduced numerous new features and enhancements, including:

Selectors: New selectors like nth-child, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes.

Box Model: Box-sizing property, box-shadow, and border-radius for creating rounded corners.

Flexbox and Grid Layout: Layout mechanisms for creating flexible and responsive grid-based layouts.

Transitions and Animations: CSS transitions and keyframe animations for adding dynamic effects to elements
.
Fonts and Typography: @font-face rule for custom web fonts, text-shadow, and text-overflow properties.

Gradients and Backgrounds: CSS gradients, multiple backgrounds, and background-size property.

Media Queries: Media query syntax for creating responsive designs based on device characteristics.

Transformations: Transform property for 2D and 3D transformations like translate, rotate, scale, and skew.

 ### Explain the difference between inline, block, and inline-block display properties in CSS.

Inline: Elements with display:inline do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They respect left and right margins but not top and bottom margins.
Block: Elements with display:block start on a new line and stretch to fill the available width of their parent container. They can have both horizontal and vertical margins and padding.
Inline-block: Elements with display:inline-block behave like inline elements in terms of flow (they don't start on a new line) but like block elements in terms of their ability to set width, height, margins, and padding.


### What are media queries in CSS3? How are they used?
Media queries allow developers to apply different CSS styles based on various characteristics of the user's device or viewport, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, etc. They are typically used in responsive web design to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries are written using the @media rule followed by one or more media feature expressions and CSS styles that apply when those conditions are met.

### Explain the purpose of CSS3 transitions and animations.
CSS3 transitions and animations allow developers to add visual effects and interactivity to web pages without relying on JavaScript or Flash. Transitions enable smooth, gradual changes in CSS properties over a specified duration, triggered by events like hover or focus. Animations, on the other hand, allow more complex and customizable animations through keyframes, specifying intermediate styles at various points in time.

### What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS? Provide examples.
Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are keywords that can be added to selectors to style elements based on their state or position in the document structure.

Pseudo-classes: Examples include :hover, :active, :focus, :nth-child(), :first-child, :last-child, etc., which target elements based on user interaction or their position within a parent.
Pseudo-elements: Examples include ::before and ::after, which allow developers to insert content before or after an element's content, and ::first-line and ::first-letter, which style the first line or first letter of an element's content.

### How does CSS3 support flexible box layout (Flexbox)?
Flexbox is a layout model introduced in CSS3 that provides a more efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It introduces properties like display:flex, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and align-self, which allow developers to create complex layouts with ease and flexibility.

### What is the purpose of CSS Grid Layout?
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system introduced in CSS3 that allows developers to create complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It provides a more powerful and intuitive way to design web layouts compared to traditional methods like floats or positioning. Grid Layout enables precise control over the placement and alignment of elements within the grid container.

### Explain the concept of responsive web design and how CSS3 facilitates it.
Responsive web design is an approach to designing and coding websites that ensure optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. CSS3 facilitates responsive design through features like media queries, flexible box layout (Flexbox), CSS Grid Layout, fluid widths, and scalable images. These techniques allow developers to create layouts that adapt and respond to changes in viewport size and device characteristics, providing a consistent user experience across different devices.

### What are CSS preprocessors? Provide examples.
CSS preprocessors are tools that extend the capabilities of CSS by introducing features like variables, mixins, nesting, and functions, which help streamline and enhance the CSS authoring process. Examples of CSS preprocessors include Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), Less, and Stylus.

### How can CSS3 gradients be created, and what are the different types available?
CSS3 gradients allow developers to create smooth transitions between two or more colors without using images. Gradients can be created using the linear-gradient() or radial-gradient() functions, specifying the starting and ending colors, directions, and color stops. Different types of gradients include:

1. Linear gradients: Transition in a straight line from one color to another.
2. Radial gradients: Transition from the center to the edge of a circle, ellipse, or rectangle.
3. Repeating gradients: Repeat the gradient pattern infinitely along the specified axis.
