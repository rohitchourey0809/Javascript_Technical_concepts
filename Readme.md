# Promises vs. Async/Await: 
Promises: Promises are a pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises provide a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

Async/Await: Async/Await is a syntax built on top of promises, introduced in ECMAScript 2017. It provides a more concise and readable way to work with asynchronous code. The async keyword is used to declare that a function returns a promise, and the await keyword is used within the function to wait for the resolution of a promise.

# Prototype in JavaScript:

In JavaScript, each object has a prototype, which is a reference to another object. This prototype object may, in turn, have its prototype, forming a prototype chain. The prototype is used for inheritance in JavaScript. When you access a property or method on an object, and it's not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype and continues up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.


# Event Bubbling:

Event bubbling is a mechanism in the DOM where an event triggered on a particular element will bubble up or propagate through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. This means that if you have nested HTML elements and an event occurs on the innermost element, the event will also trigger on all the outer elements containing it.

# Limitations of React:
Learning Curve: React has a learning curve, especially for beginners who may need time to grasp concepts like JSX, components, state, and props.
JSX Limitations: JSX might seem unintuitive to developers who are more accustomed to HTML.
SEO Issues: React applications are often single-page applications (SPAs), and there can be challenges with search engine optimization (SEO) due to the initial rendering being done on the client side.
Boilerplate Code: Some developers find that React projects can involve a lot of boilerplate code.
Context vs. Redux:

# Context in React:
 Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's often used for global state management in smaller applications where a centralized state is needed without the complexity of Redux.


# Redux:
 Redux is a state management library that is often used in larger React applications. It provides a predictable state container and follows a unidirectional data flow. Redux is suitable for complex state management scenarios where the application state needs to be managed more rigorously.
 
 
 # Controlled Components vs. Uncontrolled Components:

Controlled Components: In React, a controlled component is a component whose state is controlled by React. Form elements like input, textarea, and select maintain their own state, and their values are controlled by React through state. Changes to the input values trigger state updates.

Uncontrolled Components: An uncontrolled component is a component where the form data is handled by the DOM itself. The state is not controlled by React, and the data is accessed directly from the DOM using refs. Uncontrolled components are less common in React, but they can be useful in certain scenarios.

Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components:

Controlled Components: Form elements where the value is managed by the component state using the useState hook. User changes trigger state updates and re-renders.
Uncontrolled Components: Form elements where the value is directly accessed from the DOM using refs. They update asynchronously and might require additional logic for validation and synchronization.


Error Boundaries in React:

Error boundaries are a feature in React that allows components to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their component tree and log those errors, display a fallback UI, or take other appropriate actions. This prevents the entire application from crashing due to a single error in a component.
Example of using error boundaries:


class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}


# What is JavaScript?
Answer:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. It enables client-side scripting, allowing developers to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. JavaScript is an essential component of web development, providing the ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and communicate with servers using technologies like AJAX.

# How is JavaScript different from Java?
Answer:
Despite their similar names, JavaScript and Java are distinct programming languages. JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development, executed in web browsers. It's lightweight and dynamically typed. On the other hand, Java is a full-fledged, object-oriented programming language designed for general-purpose applications, often used for back-end development. The similarity in names is mainly due to marketing reasons, and the two languages have different use cases and syntax.

#  What are the data types in JavaScript?
Answer:
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types:

Number
String
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol (introduced in ES6)
Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:

Object
Array
Function
Date
RegExp
Primitive data types are immutable, and non-primitive types are mutable and stored by reference.

# Explain hoisting in JavaScript.
Answer:
Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This allows variables and functions to be used before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
In this example, the declaration of x is hoisted to the top, but the initialization is not. Hence, the output is undefined.

#  What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?
Answer:
The Event Loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous operations to be performed without blocking the execution of the main program. It continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the first task from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. This process ensures that asynchronous operations, such as AJAX requests or timers, are handled in a non-blocking way.

# Lazy loading

Lazy loading is a technique in which you defer the loading of non-essential resources or components until they are actually needed. In React, lazy loading is commonly used for code-splitting, where you load parts of your application only when the user navigates to a specific route or interacts with a particular feature
