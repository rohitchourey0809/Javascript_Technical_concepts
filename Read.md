# for...in loop:
Use Case: Iterating over object keys or array indices.

Example with an array:

javascript
Copy code
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

  for (let index in fruits) {
  console.log(index); // Outputs: 0, 1, 2
  console.log(fruits[index]); // Outputs: apple, banana, orange
}
Example with an object:

javascript
Copy code
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "developer"
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key); // Outputs: name, age, job
  console.log(person[key]); // Outputs: John, 30, developer
}
Note: When using for...in with arrays, it's iterating over indices, and the loop may also include properties inherited from the prototype chain.

# for...of loop:
Use Case: Iterating over iterable objects (e.g., arrays, strings).

Example with an array:

javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num); // Outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
Example with a string:

javascript
Copy code
const message = "Hello";

for (let char of message) {
  console.log(char); // Outputs: H, e, l, l, o
}
Note: The for...of loop is generally more concise and preferred when you only need the values and don't care about indices or inherited properties. It doesn't work with plain objects, but it's excellent for arrays and other iterable objects.

In summary:

Use for...in when you need to iterate over keys or indices (including inherited properties).
Use for...of when you need to iterate over values of iterable objects like arrays and strings.
